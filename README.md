# AdventureWorks_Analysis
Analyzing the Adventure Works dataset using Azure cloud services, practicing and refining my data engineering skills.
Configuration Steps :
  - Create a Resource Group in Azure
  - Create a Data Lake (it is a storage account with Hierarchical Namespace enabled. If you don't enable it by default it will create a Blob Storage)
  - Create the required Containers inside the DataLake (In this case I have created 3, Stage (importing dataset), Processing, and final)
  - Create the Data Factory
